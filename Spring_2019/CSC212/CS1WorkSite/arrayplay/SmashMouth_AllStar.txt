Somebody once told me the world is gonna roll me
I aint the sharpest tool in the shed
She was looking kind of dumb with her finger and her thumb
In the shape of an L on her forehead
Well the years start coming and they dont stop coming
Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running
Didnt make sense not to live for fun
Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb
So much to do so much to see
So whats wrong with taking the back streets
Youll never know if you dont go
Youll never shine if you dont glow
Hey now youre an all-star get your game on go play
Hey now youre a rock star get the show on get paid
And all that glitters is gold
Only shooting stars break the mold
Its a cool place and they say it gets colder
Youre bundled up now wait till you get older
But the meteor men beg to differ
Judging by the hole in the satellite picture
The ice we skate is getting pretty thin
The waters getting warm so you might as well swim
My worlds on fire how about yours
Thats the way I like it and I never get bored
Hey now youre an allstar get your game on go play
Hey now youre a rock star get the show on get paid
All that glitters is gold
Only shooting stars break the mold
Hey now youre an allstar get your game on go play
Hey now youre a rock star get the show on get paid
And all that glitters is gold
Only shooting stars
Somebody once asked could I spare some change for gas
I need to get myself away from this place
I said yep what a concept
I could use a little fuel myself
And we could all use a little change
Well the years start coming and they dont stop coming
Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running
Didnt make sense not to live for fun
Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb
So much to do so much to see
So whats wrong with taking the back streets
Youll never know if you dont go go
Youll never shine if you dont glow
Hey now youre an allstar get your game on go play
Hey now youre a rock star get the show on get paid
And all that glitters is gold
Only shooting stars break the mold
And all that glitters is gold
Only shooting stars break the mold
