		<h1>Mine Sweeper 6C</h1>
		<p>Assignment 6 is a start of an app which will eventually incorporate sound and graphics.</p>

			<p> First, I copied and pasted the given code for the Mine Sweeper application.</p>
			<p>Then I went and changed some code... </p>
      <p>There were originally blanks that I had to fill in after the TODOs</p>
      <a href="main.png"><img src="TODO1.png"/></a>
      <p>I had to figure out how to insert mines in my application</p>
      <a href="main.png"><img src="TODO2.png"/></a>
      <p>Then I filled this one in...</p>
      <a href="main.png"><img src="TODO3.png"/></a>
      <p>The above one was the hardest one! Trial and error for too many hours!!</p>
      <p>This is what the app looked like before...</p>
			<a href="main.png"><img src="B4.png"/></a>
      <p>After all the edits I did, some color changes and photo and background noice changes...</p>
      <a href="main.png"><img src="HS1.png"/></a>
      <p>I renamed the background music and the photos the same name as the given names so it wont confuse the code.</p>
      <a href="main.png"><img src="After.png"/></a>
      <p>Thats what it looks like, booms, clicks and all...</p>
      <a href="main.png"><img src="Files.png"/></a>
      <p>Above are the files I used. </p>
			<p>boom.mp3 was changed to Marvin Martian from the Looney Toons saying "Where's the Kaboom? There was supose to be an Earth shattering Kaboom!"</p>
			<p>The click.mp3 was replaced with Homer Simposon saying his famous Doh!</p>
			<p>And the score.mp3 was changed to the Wii theme song but everytime in goes dun dun dun the bass is boosted.</p>
