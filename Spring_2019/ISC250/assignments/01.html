    <p>Answer:</p>
    <p>For Assignment 01, I already had a website. So I...</p>
    <ul>
      <li><p>Created a new link in my Home Page called Spring 2019 classes.</p></li>
      <li><p>There, I put all of my classes that I was taking this semester.</p></li>
      <li><p>From there in the ICS 250 Folder I put an index.html file that split up all my assignments.</p></li>
      <li><p>I then made another folder called assignments where I put a 01.html file inside of it.</p></li>
      <li><p>There I made an internal styles sheet. Where I changed the font, font color and background color.</p></li>
      <li><p>From there I made two unordered lists containing the Question and the Answer.</p></li>
      <li><p>I then linked the page to ISC 250 Assignment #1 - suite of web pages site.</p></li>
      <li><p>Finally, when all was done. I went to CyberDuck and uploaded the website to see how it looked.</p></li>
